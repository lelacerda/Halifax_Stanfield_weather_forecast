# Capstone Project: Weather evolution around Halifax area - from 1960 to 2023
## Objective: 
Evaluate how weather changed along the years around Halifax area and how this is related to head demand for buildings. 

## Data:
The data source for this project is the [Government of Canada website](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_stations_e.html?searchType=stnName&timeframe=1&txtStationName=Halifax&searchMethod=contains&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2023&Year=2023&Month=3&Day=21&selRowPerPage=25)

## Scope: 
 1) Gather weather data from Canada government website on CSV file
 2) Do some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 3) Clean data where required
 4) Show climate evolution using graphs
 5) Build a regression model to predict future weather trends using Pycaret
 6) Build a regressiob model using scikit-Learn
